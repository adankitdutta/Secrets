# Secrets
This is a minimalized version of the Whisper app where we can post our secrets anonymously either by using simple signup or by using OAuth.I have used Google login as OAuth for this web app.

To run this first we will need to create a .env file and put the Google Authorization credentials in it.Then we can start it locally using node commands.
